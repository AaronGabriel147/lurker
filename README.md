# About Lurker:

Lurker is a React web app that searches any sub-reddit and returns real time images, titles, and a links to the original post. This is a much faster and more user friendly way to view image posts on reddit. 

Lurker is approx 90% complete, if time allows I plan on adding an async feature that waits for an API GET request to complete, and if that request has a length over 0, it will scroll down to the first image, thus eliminating an unnecessary step for the user. 

Some possible future features, Framer animations, and user log ins to save favorite sub reddits.
